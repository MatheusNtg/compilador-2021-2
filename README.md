# mgol-go

This is a compiler for mgol implemented in go for the final work of the compilers course.

**PS. This project must be run only on linux machines**

## How to run

First create a mgol file and name as you want. For example: `file.mgol`
Then in the project root, run the following command:
```bash
go run src/main.go file.mgol
```

the compiler will generate a file named `programa.c` that you can compile to binary code using your preferred C compiler.
